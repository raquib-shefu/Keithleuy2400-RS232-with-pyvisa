# Keithleuy2400-RS232-with-pyvisa
I am using pyvisa package with NI visa to control keithley SMU2400 through RS232.
This is a part of a large project and I am still working on it. It can measure a data point with almost 1ms/point and can read upto 2500 (maximum buffer size for K2400).Install pyvisa and NI visa.
